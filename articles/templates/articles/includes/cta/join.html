                <p>Academic work should be available and affordable for all. 
                    Great institutions are important, and we do not seek to 
                    replace them, but there are limitations to what they can and will do. 
                    The Academy looks to remedy those limitations by connecting 
                    academics to communities directly in a way that benefits both, 
                    as well as enhances the knowledge bank we can all share and benefit from.</p>

                <p>As soon as you sign up, you can submit work in the form of articles
                    for other academics to purchase. Simply head to your academic 'HUB'
                    for direction on submitting articles. You can also submit proposals, 
                    which are pieces of work that haven't yet been completed, and other 
                    academics can stake you by purchasing these. You can keep track of 
                    how much has been staked and by how many academics in your HUB. 
                    Finally, you can follow other academics to keep updated with their work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you submit articles and proposals and network with other academics, 
                    building your reputation and influence, you'll be awarded points that 
                    contribute towards your academic level.
